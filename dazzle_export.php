/* WooCommerce DAZzle Address Export script
*  Version 1.0.0
*  Export lots of addresses from WooCommerce orders into a .txt file DAZzle can use to import addresses quickly
*
*  This script can be copied into functions.php or in a script managing plugin
*
*  Use this to export a list of order addresses for USPS DAZzle as a tab-deliminated text file
*  DAZzle can load the text file from Design --> Layout --> Address lookup from --> External file
*  In DAZzle on the first time you load the output file you will need to map the fields
*  You will also need to select tab as the delimiter and select Skip first row
*  Once configured, press OK and DAZzle will process and verify all the addresses and re-save the text file
*  Now go to Address Book --> File --> Import and select the text file, it should load them into the address book
*  You can now delete ADDRESSES.txt
*  Hereafter all you have to do is re-download ADDRESSES.txt every time you want to import more orders
*  Make sure to delete the old ADDRESSES.txt so that you don't get a (1) added to the filename so DAZzle will remember the field mapping
*
*  I hope this script helps you save time with WooCommerce and DAZzle */
